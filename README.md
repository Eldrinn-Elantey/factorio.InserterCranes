# Factorio: Inserter Cranes
When creating train stations in factorio, I disliked the amount of inserters/loaders required for every single cargo wagon.
This mod adds larger inserters called cranes with larger hand stack sizes and up-scaled throughput based on the building size.

# Notes
Feel free to review and improve my code.

If you want me to support more inserters please provide a pull request
